<h3>Chicken Salad Recipe</h3>

<p>Of all the summer salads, a classic chicken salad recipe is always a favorite at a picnic, 
    a barbecue, or an office potluck! Just a few ingredients can be transformed into a cold, 
    creamy salad or filling for a homemade chicken salad sandwich or wrap!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use leftovers from last night’s dinner or leftover rotisserie chicken or grilled chicken. 
        Ensure the chicken is cooled and shred or chop the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
        <li>As this is a classic chicken salad recipe, I’ve kept the additions to a minimum. Celery for crunch, green onions for flavor.</li>
        <li>This recipe can be made with a variety of nuts, veggies, and fruit for added flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Chicken salad with grapes, avocado or dried cranberries is a favorite. Pecans or almonds pair well with this recipe.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise is the base of this recipe and it’s simply seasoned.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop cooked and cooled chicken and place into a large bowl with celery and onions.</li>
        <li>Mix dressing ingredients (per recipe below) in a bowl. Toss with chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve on rolls, bread or over a bead of lettuce.</li>
    </ol>
